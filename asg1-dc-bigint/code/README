asg1-dc-bigint

The ydc executable attempts to replicate the UNIX dc function
(desktop calculator). It reads in RPN formatted numbers and
operations (ex: "1 1 +" is "1 + 1"), and performs calculations
with the input. What makes ydc unique is it utilizes the bigint
class which has no limits to length of numbers (number of
digits).

I added a couple lines to the main.cpp to prevent seg faults
when there is no stack and certain functions are called
(namely print and duplicate).



Usage:
   Type "ydc" in the shell.

Operations include:
   + Addition. Adds the top two numbers on the stack.
   - Subtraction. Subtracts the top number on the stack from
      the next item from the stack.
   * Multiplication. Multiplies the top two numbers on the
      stack.
   / Division. Divides the second number on the stack by the
      top number on the stack.
   % Modulus. Takes the modulus of the second number on the
      stack by the top number on the stack.
   ^ Pow function. Outputs the second top number on the stack
      to the power of the top number of the stack.
   c Clear. Clears the stack.
   d Duplicate. Duplicate number on the top of the stack.
   f Print all. Prints the entire stack, one by one (starting
      from the bottom).
   p Print. Prints the top number on the stack.
   q Quit. Quits the ydc program.
