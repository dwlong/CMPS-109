yshell

This is a simple shell program that creates and
manages a small, tree file-structure. As of right
now, everything should be functional except for
the rmr. I'm submitting now just in case because
it's WAY past submission time. I'll hopefully be
complete before it's due.

I haven't tested for leaks. Also, the ls and lsr
do not order files lexicographically yet.

Usage:
   "yshell"

Once in the shell, you can type commands ranging from:
   # <string>
      Commented line
   cat <pathname(s)>
      Outputs the contents of specified files
   cd <pathname>
      Changes directory to the path specified
   echo <words>
      Outputs the words typed.
   ls <pathname>
      Outputs a file list for the specified directory
   lsr <pathname>
      Same as above, but recursively travels (DFS Preorder)
      through the sub-directories
   make <pathname> [words]
      Creates a file at specified pathname. Words are
      optional, but, if added, fill the file. Existing
      files are emptied or overwritten.
   mkdir <pathname>
      Creates a directory at specified pathname.
   prompt <string>
      Sets the prompt to the input string. (Default is "% ")
   rm <pathname>
      Removes the specified file or directory (if empty).
   rmr <pathname> *
      Recursive removal (DFS Postorder)

* Not yet implemented
