keyvalue

   The keyvalue program effectively just manages
   a linked list of keys and values. Everything
   should be functional. The skecthiest part of
   the code would probably be the find() function
   of listmap as I could not get it to work
   without making it non-const, allowing a programmer
   more access than he/she needed from the find()
   function.

   Didn't change the ++ and -- operators of the
   iterator class as I never needed any of the
   special functionality from changing them.

Usage:
   keyvalue [-@ flags] [filename...]

Within the files, input is read as any of the following:
   # [string]
      Commented line.
   key
      Prints out value found at corresponding key.
   key =
      Erases key and value found at key.
   key = value
      Replaces or inserts key and value pair in
      increasing lexicographic order (by key). 
      Additionally, prints the key and value pair.
   =
      Prints every key and value pair in
      lexicographic order.
   = value
      Prints all of the key and value pairs with
      the given value in lexicographic order.
